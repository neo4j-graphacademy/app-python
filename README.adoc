== A Note on comments

You may spot a number of comments in this repository that look a little like this:

[source,python]
----
# tag::something[]
someCode()
# end::something[]
----


We use link:https://asciidoc-py.github.io/index.html[Asciidoc^] to author our courses.
Using these tags means that we can use a macro to include portions of code directly into the course itself.

From the point of view of the course, you can go ahead and ignore them.


== Setting up your environment

[source,sh]
----
python -m venv neoflix

source neoflix/bin/activate
----
